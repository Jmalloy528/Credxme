You're feeling good. You go to buy a house. The lender pulls your credit. [PAUSE] 680. What happened?\n\n[INTEREST - 15-35 seconds]\nHere's the truth nobody tells you. Credit Karma uses VantageScore 3.0. Mortgage lenders use FICO Score 2. [PAUSE] That's FORTY years of difference in algorithm technology.\n\nVantageScore counts your rent and utilities. FICO doesn't.

That's $72,000 you're throwing away because you trusted the wrong number.\n\n[ACTION - 60-75 seconds]\nStop guessing. Get your actual FICO scores for free. I've put together a complete guide that shows you exactly where to get them, plus the 3 other mistakes killing your credit.\n\nLink in bio.
