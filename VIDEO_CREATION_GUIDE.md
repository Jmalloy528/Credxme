## 🎨 Step-by-Step Krea Creation Process

### Step 1: Log into Krea AI
1. Go to https://krea.ai
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Select "Image" generation mode (for static scenes)
4. OR Select "Video" generation mode (if available with your plan)

### Step 2: Generate Each Scene

Copy and paste these prompts one by one into Krea:

---

#### SCENE 1: Hook (0-3 seconds)
**Krea Prompt:**
```
Cartoon elephant character with glasses, looking shocked, pointing at phone showing credit score app, surprised expression, blue background, professional lighting, vibrant colors, 4k quality, Pixar style character design, credit score numbers floating around
```

**Text Overlay:**
```
Credit Karma is lying to you.
```

**Voiceover:**
"Credit Karma is lying to you."

---

#### SCENE 2: The Problem (3-10 seconds)
**Krea Prompt:**
```
Cartoon elephant with glasses scratching head confused, holding two smartphones showing different credit scores, question marks floating around head, concerned expression, split screen showing 720 vs 680, blue and orange color scheme, professional lighting
```

**Text Overlay:**
```
They say 720, but bank says 680?
```

**Voiceover:**
"They tell you your score is 720, but when you go to buy a house, the bank says it's 680. What happened?"

---

#### SCENE 3: The Truth (10-30 seconds)
**Krea Prompt:**
```
Cartoon elephant with glasses as teacher, standing at chalkboard with pointer, showing two credit score cards side by side, educational classroom setting, one card labeled "VantageScore 3.0" in blue, one labeled "FICO Score 2" in green, mathematical formulas in background, friendly explaining gesture
```

**Text Overlay:**
```
Credit Karma uses VantageScore.
Banks use FICO.
```

**Voiceover:**
"Here's the truth: Credit Karma uses VantageScore 3.0. Mortgage lenders use FICO Score 2. That's 40 years apart in algorithm technology. VantageScore counts rent and utilities. FICO doesn't. VantageScore weighs recent history more. FICO looks at everything."

**Krea Prompt:**
```
Cartoon elephant with glasses using calculator, math equations floating in air, credit report papers flying around, explaining gesture with hands, infographic style showing 20-50 point difference, blue background with data visualization elements

20-50 point difference is normal.
```

**Voiceover:**
"That's why there's a 20 to 50 point difference. I had a client last month. Credit Karma said 740. Actual FICO was 690. He almost lost his dream house because of this gap."

Don't trust Credit Karma for mortgages!

"Don't trust Credit Karma for mortgages! Check your real FICO score before applying."

---

Cartoon elephant with glasses smiling, pointing down with finger, call to action pose, yellow arrow pointing down, friendly encouraging expression, blue background, "Learn More" vibe, professional but approachable, 4k quality
```
