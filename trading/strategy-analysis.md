## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This is a **proven, backtested spike reversal strategy** used successfully for 17+ years by the trader, now codified with AI assistance. The core concept: **price creates a spike (sharp move) outside normal ranges, then reverses when it closes back inside**.

**Key Win Rate Enhancers Discovered via AI Backtesting:**
- 150% ATR clearance beats 100% (bigger wick = better trade)
- Counter-trend entries on daily timeframe beat trend-following entries
- BUT direction of weekly trend improves win rate further
- Ichimoku cloud positioning matters (below cloud for bullish reversals)

---

## CORE STRATEGY: THE 30-MINUTE SPIKE

### What Is a Spike?
A spike occurs when price **slams down (or up) in the first 30 minutes of the session**, creates a large wick, and **closes back inside the prior range**. This signals a reversal.

### Entry Criteria (ALL must align):

1. **Timeframe**: First 30 minutes of trading session
2. **Price Action**: Sharp spike DOWN (for longs) or UP (for shorts)
3. **ATR Clearance**: The spike must clear **150%+ of Average True Range** (bigger wick = higher probability)
   - Original threshold: 100%
   - Optimized threshold: 150%
   - Diminishing returns above 150%
4. **Close Back Inside**: Price must close back inside the range it broke
5. **Ichimoku Filter**: 
   - For longs: Price below the cloud (counter-trend on daily)
   - BUT: In direction of weekly trend
6. **Volume Profile**: Major volume profile levels add confluence

### Exit Strategy:

**Targets:**
- Primary: 50% retracement of the move
- Using Ichimoku Kijun-sen (monthly) as target proxy
- Fixed R-multiple targets also viable

**Stop Loss:**
- Below the spike low (for longs)
- Above the spike high (for shorts)

### Asset Classes:
- **Stocks**: Dollar General (DG), Intel (INTC), Amedisys (AMED), etc.
- **Futures**: ES (E-mini S&P 500)
- **Crypto**: Bitcoin (cautious - volatile)

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT RULES

### Position Sizing:
- Use small account to test ($25,000-$26,000 mentioned)
- Scale into proven setups only
- Pattern Day Trader rule compliance (avoid too many day trades in small account)

### Maximum Risk:
- Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
- Expect 40%+ drawdowns on volatile assets (Bitcoin example)

### When NOT to Trade:
- Tech stocks at all-time highs (Nvidia, AMD topping patterns)
- When trend is unclear (market ranging)
- Earnings days (unless volume profile level very clear)
- If spike doesn't clear 125% ATR minimum

---

## INDICATOR SETUP

### Required Indicators:
1. **Ichimoku Cloud** (Daily and Weekly timeframes)
   - Daily: Trade counter-trend (below cloud for longs)
   - Weekly: Trade in direction of trend
2. **ATR (Average True Range)**
   - Measure spike size vs ATR
   - Minimum 125%, optimal 150%
3. **Volume Profile**
   - Look for Point of Control (POC) levels
   - Major volume nodes = support/resistance
4. **50% Fibonacci Retracement**
   - Primary target for swing trades
   - From major high to major low

### Scanner Parameters:
- 30-minute spike detection
- ATR clearance >125%
- Below/above Ichimoku cloud
- Volume profile confluence

## BACKTESTED INSIGHTS FROM AI ANALYSIS

The trader built a custom backtesting system using AI to validate his 17 years of intuition:

### What Works:
1. **150% ATR Clearance**: Proved statistically better than 100%
2. **Counter-Trend on Daily**: Reversals work best against daily trend
3. **Trend-Following on Weekly**: But weekly trend direction improves win rate
4. **Volume Profile Levels**: Major POC levels from prior years act as magnets
5. **First 30 Minutes**: The spike phenomenon is strongest at market open

### What Doesn't Work:
- Small ATR clearances (under 100%)
- Trading WITH daily trend (lower win rate)
- Ignoring weekly timeframe context
- Chasing after the spike closes

### Null Hypothesis Considerations:
- Account for slippage in backtests
- Most "edges" disappear when tested
- Only trade what you can prove works over 10+ years of data

## TRADE EXAMPLES FROM TRANSCRIPT

### Example 1: Dollar General (DG) - WINNER
- **Setup**: Volume profile level from March 2024 (major support)
- **Entry**: Spike down to volume profile POC
- **Target**: 50% retracement from all-time high to low = $164
- **Result**: $745 profit in small account
- **Note**: Already in position from March, this was an add-on trade

### Example 2: Hims & Hers (HIMS) - POTENTIAL SETUP
- **Setup**: Volume profile level at $17.61
- **Analysis**: Same pattern as Dollar General
- **Status**: Watching for spike entry
- **Risk**: Holding but not holding firmly

### Example 3: Netflix (NFLX) - MISSED OPPORTUNITY
- **Setup**: Hit $76.90 (50% retracement level)
- **Analysis**: Objectively good level
- **Status**: Trader passed due to personal bias (disliked company)

### Example 4: Amedisys (AMED) - WINNER
- **Setup**: High-quality spike trade
- **Result**: Taken during live stream week

### Example 5: Futures (ES) - SHORT THEN FLIP
- **Wednesday**: Short spike at high, flipped bearish
- **Today (Friday)**: Flipped bullish for weekend close
- **Strategy**: Trading the range between 6766-6700 support

## MARKET ANALYSIS INSIGHTS

### Current Market View (as of video):
- **Tech**: Pulling back from highs (Nvidia, AMD topping)
- **Broad Market**: Ranging, not trending
- **Crypto**: Bitcoin topped at $126K, bearish phase
- **Dollar General**: $164 target (50% retracement)

### Levels to Watch:
- **ES (S&P 500 Futures)**: 6766, 6700 support
- **AMD**: Potential double top, support at $171-$172
- **Nvidia**: Weekly spike, support at $140-$149 range
- **Netflix**: $76.90 (50% level)

### Sectors to Avoid Shorting Right Now:
- Tech (already pulling back)
- AI stocks (still bullish long-term)

### Sectors to Watch for Longs:
- Value plays at volume profile levels
- Dollar stores (Dollar General)
- Healthcare (volume profile setups)

## THE AI ADVANTAGE

The trader emphasizes using AI to:

1. **Backtest Ideas**: Test strategies across 10+ years of data
2. **Optimize Parameters**: Find best ATR thresholds, timeframes
3. **Build Scanners**: Automate finding spike setups
4. **Manage Context**: Store trading knowledge, never forget
5. **Generate Ideas**: Ask "what happens if..." questions

### The Race Against Time:
The trader repeatedly states: **"The goal is to make as much money as possible before every chart looks like this"** (efficient, no edge).

Once everyone has AI trading bots, all edges disappear. **The window is 12-18 months** to capitalize before AI democratizes all alpha.

## CRITICAL WARNINGS

### Bitcoin/Crypto:
- **Not** the institutional safe haven people claimed
- **44% drawdown in one quarter** (proven in 2025)
- No fiduciary will touch 60% volatility assets
- Apathy, not quantum computing, is Bitcoin's greatest threat

### General Trading Wisdom:
1. **Trend is your friend** - Quantified via backtesting
2. **Don't short strength** - Wait for clear topping patterns
3. **Use emotion/intuition** - But validate with data
4. **Account for slippage** - Real results differ from theory
5. **Most edges are mirages** - Only trade proven, tested setups

### Risk Reality Check:
- 25% daily returns = lottery ticket gambling
- Professional traders aim for 1-3% daily
- Volatility cuts both ways (Bitcoin example)
- **"You get paid to take risk"**
