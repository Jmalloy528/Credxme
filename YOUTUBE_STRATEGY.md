   - Sounds like you, scales infinitely

3. **Video Creation** (Descript / CapCut)
   - Stock footage (Pexels/Storyblocks)
   - Text overlays
   - B-roll of credit reports, calculators

4. **Thumbnail Creation** (Canva API)
   - Template with face + big text
   - "I was SHOCKED" / "This changed everything"
   - High contrast, readable at small sizes

5. **Scheduling** (YouTube API)
   - Upload daily at 8 AM EST

### The Math to $1M

**Affiliate Revenue:**
- 100 leads/day × 30 days = 3,000 leads/month
- 10% conversion to affiliate products = 300 sales
- $50 average commission = $15,000/month

**Credit Repair Services:**
- 3% of leads convert to Aggressive Repair
- 90 leads/month × $500 = $45,000/month

**Business Builder:**
- 1% convert to Business services
- 30 leads/month × $1,500 avg = $45,000/month

**Total: $105,000/month = $1.26M/year**

This is achievable in 12-18 months with consistent content.
