If you're struggling with bad credit, you're not alone. Over 30% of Americans have subprime credit scores, and most of them are making the same five mistakes—mistakes based on myths that sound logical but are financially devastating.

At CredX, we've helped hundreds of New Yorkers boost their scores and secure better financial futures. Today, we're exposing the five most dangerous credit myths that keep people trapped in debt and poor credit.

## Myth #1: Checking Your Credit Score Hurts Your Credit

**The Myth:** Every time you check your credit, your score drops.

**The Truth:** Checking your own credit is called a "soft inquiry" and has zero impact on your score.

Here's what actually affects your score:

- **Hard inquiries** (when lenders check your credit): Small, temporary impact (3-5 points)
- **Soft inquiries** (when you check your own credit): No impact whatsoever
- **Credit applications**: The application creates the hard pull, not checking your score

**The Smart Move:** Check your credit monthly using free services like Credit Karma, your bank app, or AnnualCreditReport.com. Regular monitoring helps you catch errors early, spot identity theft, and track your progress.

## Myth #2: You Need to Carry a Balance to Build Credit

**The Myth:** Leave a small balance on your credit cards to show "activity" and boost your score.

**The Truth:** This myth makes credit card companies rich while keeping you poor.

**Here's how credit utilization actually works:**

Credit utilization (30% of your FICO score) measures how much of your available credit you're using. The sweet spot is under 30% utilization, ideally under 10%.

**The correct strategy:**
1. Use your credit card for regular purchases
2. Let the statement close
3. Pay the balance in full before the due date

Your statement shows utilization, but you pay zero interest. Carrying a $1,000 balance at 24% APR costs you $240 per year—for nothing.

## Myth #3: Closing Old Credit Cards Helps Your Score

**The Myth:** Once you pay off a credit card, close the account to "clean up" your credit.

**The Truth:** Closing old accounts can tank your score by 20-50 points instantly.

**Two things happen when you close an old card:**

1. **Your utilization jumps.** If you have $10,000 in available credit across two cards and close one with a $5,000 limit, your utilization doubles even if your spending stays the same.

2. **Your credit age drops.** The age of your accounts makes up 15% of your FICO score. That 10-year-old card you've had since college? It's helping your average age. Close it, and your "credit history" gets younger.

**The Smart Move:** Keep old cards open. Use them for one small purchase every 6 months, set up autopay, and let them continue building your credit age for free.

## Myth #4: Paying Collections Removes Them from Your Report

**The Myth:** Pay off that collections account and it disappears from your credit report.

**The Truth:** Paid collections stay on your report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency.

**Understanding collections:**

- Collection accounts remain for 7 years regardless of payment status
- Paid collections may help slightly with newer scoring models (FICO 9, VantageScore 3.0)
- Most mortgage lenders still use older models that treat paid collections the same as unpaid

**Better options:**

1. **Pay for delete:** Negotiate with the collector to remove the item entirely in exchange for payment (get it in writing first)
2. **Dispute accuracy:** If the debt is inaccurate, unverifiable, or outdated, dispute it
3. **Goodwill deletion:** Ask the original creditor to remove the negative mark as a gesture of goodwill

Every situation is unique. Sometimes paying is the right move. Sometimes it's throwing money away.

## Myth #5: You Can't Fix Your Credit Yourself

**The Myth:** Credit repair is complicated, mysterious, and requires professional help.

**The Truth:** Everything a credit repair company does, you can do yourself—for free.

**DIY credit repair basics:**

1. **Get your reports** from all three bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com
2. **Identify errors** and gather supporting documentation
3. **File disputes** online or via certified mail
4. **Follow up** and track results
5. **Optimize** your credit utilization and mix

**So why hire a professional?**

The same reason you might hire a mechanic instead of changing your own oil: expertise, efficiency, and peace of mind.

- Know which disputes work and which don't
- Understand creditor negotiation tactics
- Have systems to track and follow up
