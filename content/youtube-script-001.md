"What if I told you that everything you think you know about credit is actually keeping you broke? I've seen it happen time and time again - good people, hard workers, stuck in financial quicksand because they bought into these five dangerous myths. By the end of this video, you'll know exactly what they are and how to fix them. I'm James Malloy from CredX, and let's get into it."

## [MYTH #1 - 0:15-1:30]

### Myth: "Checking my credit score hurts my credit"

**[B-roll: Person nervously looking at phone]**

"This is probably the most common one I hear. People are literally afraid to look at their own credit report because they think it'll drop their score. Listen to me carefully - this is 100% false.

There are two types of credit inquiries: hard pulls and soft pulls. When you check your own credit through Credit Karma, your bank app, or AnnualCreditReport.com - that's a soft pull. It doesn't affect your score at all. Zero. Nada.

Hard pulls happen when you apply for credit - a car loan, mortgage, credit card. Those can ding your score by a few points temporarily, but even then, it's usually 5 points or less and bounces back in a few months.

**[Screen share: Show Credit Karma interface]**

The truth? You should be checking your credit monthly. Not looking is like ignoring a check engine light - small problems become disasters. I've seen $50 medical bills turn into 100-point score drops because someone didn't check their report.

## [MYTH #2 - 1:30-2:45]

### Myth: "I need to carry a balance to build credit"

**[B-roll: Person making minimum payment]**

"This one makes credit card companies very rich and keeps you very poor. The myth goes: leave a small balance on your card, pay the minimum, and your score goes up.

Absolute nonsense.

Your credit utilization - that's how much of your available credit you're using - should be under 30%, ideally under 10%. But here's the key: you don't need to carry a balance to show utilization. Use your card, let the statement close, then pay it off in full before the due date.

**[Screen share: Credit utilization calculator]**

Let me show you the math. You have a $5,000 limit card. You spend $500. Statement closes - you owe $500. Your utilization shows 10%. Now you pay it off completely before the due date. Your utilization was reported as 10%, you paid no interest, your score gets the boost.

Carrying that $500 balance at 24% APR costs you $120 per year in interest. For what? Nothing. Pay your cards in full every single month.

## [MYTH #3 - 2:45-4:00]

### Myth: "Closing old credit cards will help my score"

**[B-roll: Person cutting up credit card]**

"I get the psychology here. You finally paid off that card you maxed out in college, and you want to celebrate by cutting it up and closing the account. Feels good, right?

Wrong move. Potentially very expensive move.

Two things happen when you close an old account. First, your credit utilization jumps because you just lost that available credit. Second, and this is the killer - you lose that account's age history.

**[Screen share: Credit age calculation]**

Credit age is 15% of your FICO score. If you have a 10-year-old card and a 2-year-old card, your average age is 6 years. Close the 10-year-old card, and your average drops to 2 years. That can cost you 20-30 points instantly.

Keep those old cards open. Use them once every 6 months for a coffee, pay it off immediately. They keep your utilization low and your age high. It's free credit history.

## [MYTH #4 - 4:00-5:00]

### Myth: "Paying collections removes them from my report"

**[B-roll: Person on phone with collection agency]**

"This one breaks my heart because people get scammed by it constantly. Collection agencies love this myth. They call you up, pressure you, tell you "just pay it and it'll come off your report."

Here's the truth: paying a collection doesn't remove it. That negative mark stays on your credit report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency, whether you pay it or not. Paid collections still hurt your score.

**[Screen share: Credit report with paid collection]**

Now, does paying it help? Sometimes slightly, depending on the scoring model. But you're usually better off negotiating a "pay for delete" - where they agree to remove the item entirely in exchange for payment. Or challenging the debt's accuracy. Or waiting for it to age off.

Every situation is different. Sometimes paying is the right move. Sometimes it's throwing money away. You need a strategy, not just a payment.

## [MYTH #5 - 5:00-6:00]

### Myth: "I can't fix my credit myself - I need to hire someone"

**[Direct to camera, earnest]**

"And here's where I tell you the truth that might seem weird coming from a guy who runs a credit repair company. You absolutely CAN fix your credit yourself. Everything I do for my clients - disputing errors, negotiating with creditors, optimizing utilization - you can learn to do it yourself.

It's like fixing your car. You can learn to change your oil, rotate tires, do basic maintenance. Some people love that. They watch YouTube videos, buy the tools, get their hands dirty.

But most people? They're busy. They have jobs, kids, lives. They'd rather pay a mechanic who does this every day, has the tools, knows the shortcuts, and can guarantee the work.

**[Direct address]**

That's what CredX is. We're the credit mechanics. Do you NEED us? No. But if you've got errors on your report, collections you don't recognize, or you just want someone who knows the system inside and out fighting for every point - that's what we do.
