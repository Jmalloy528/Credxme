🚨 CREDIT MYTH BUSTING THREAD 🚨

Most people are walking around with bad credit because they believe these 5 dangerous myths:

❌ Checking your score hurts it
❌ Carry a balance to build credit
❌ Close old cards to clean up credit

Here's the truth nobody tells you 👇

MYTH #3: "Close old credit cards to help your score"

REALITY: Closing that 10-year-old card can DROP your score 20-50 points instantly.

Why? You lose:
• That credit limit (utilization jumps)
• That account age (15% of your score)

Keep old cards OPEN. Use them once every 6 months. Let them work for you.

MYTH #5: "You can't fix your credit yourself"

REALITY: You absolutely can DIY credit repair.

But should you?

If you're busy, stressed, or just want someone who knows the system fighting for every point—we're here.

🚨 STOP believing these credit myths! 🚨

The #1 mistake I see? People carrying credit card balances because they think it "builds credit."

NO. ❌

Here's the truth:
✅ Pay your cards IN FULL every month
✅ Keep old cards OPEN (even if paid off)
✅ Check your credit monthly (it doesn't hurt!)
✅ Challenge errors on your report

Your credit score is costing you money every single day:
• Higher interest rates
• Bigger security deposits
• Missed opportunities

But it's not permanent. You can fix it.

## LINKEDIN POST

I talk to people every week who are stuck with bad credit—not because they're irresponsible, but because they're following outdated advice that sounds logical but is financially devastating.

Here are 5 credit myths I hear constantly in my credit repair practice:

1️⃣ "Checking my credit hurts my score"
Soft inquiries (when YOU check) have zero impact. Hard inquiries (credit applications) have minimal, temporary impact.

2️⃣ "I need to carry a balance to build credit"
This makes credit card companies rich. Pay in full every month. Your utilization gets reported without you paying interest.

3️⃣ "Closing old cards helps my score"
Closing that old card can drop your score 20-50 points. Keep it open. Age of accounts matters.

4️⃣ "Paying collections removes them"
Paid collections stay for 7 years. Negotiate "pay for delete" or dispute accuracy instead.

5️⃣ "I can't fix credit myself"
You absolutely can DIY. But many people prefer to hire experts who know the system, understand creditor tactics, and can guarantee results.

The bottom line: Bad credit isn't a character flaw. It's a math problem with a solution.

What's the worst credit myth you've heard?

🛑 STOP! Before you pay that collection account, read this... 🛑

Collection agencies LOVE telling you "just pay it and it'll come off your report."

Here's what they don't tell you:

👉 Paid collections STAY on your credit report for 7 years
👉 Your score barely improves (if at all)
👉 You just gave them money for nothing

Better options:
✅ Negotiate "pay for delete" (get it in writing!)
✅ Dispute the accuracy if it's wrong
✅ Wait for it to age off naturally
✅ Hire a professional who knows the law

Every situation is different. Sometimes paying makes sense. Sometimes it's throwing money away.

💡 Quick Credit Tip 💡

Should you close that old credit card you finally paid off?

NO! 🛑

Here's what happens when you close an old card:
❌ Your credit utilization jumps (bad)
❌ Your average account age drops (bad)
❌ You lose that available credit (bad)

I've seen people drop 30-50 points by closing their oldest card.

SMART MOVE: Keep it open!
• Use it for one small purchase every 6 months
• Set up autopay so you never miss it
• Let it keep building your credit age for FREE

That 10-year-old card with a $5,000 limit? It's worth its weight in gold to your credit score.
