## 📹 VIDEO 1: MONDAY - Credit Karma Scores (Myth Buster)
**Title:** "Credit Karma Is Lying to You (Here's the Truth)"
**Hook:** "I fell for this credit myth for years..."

### SCRIPT:
```
[0-3s HOOK]
Credit Karma is lying to you.

[3-10s AGITATE]  
They tell you your score is 720, but when you go to buy a house,
the bank says it's 680. What happened?

[10-45s TRUTH]
Here's the truth: Credit Karma uses VantageScore 3.0.
Mortgage lenders use FICO Score 2. That's 40 years apart in
algorithm technology.

VantageScore counts rent and utilities. FICO doesn't.
VantageScore weighs recent history more. FICO looks at everything.

That's why there's a 20-50 point difference.

[45-55s PROOF]
I had a client last month. Credit Karma: 740. Actual FICO: 690.
He almost lost his dream house because of this gap.

**Title:** "How I Went From 520 to 720 in 6 Months"
**Hook:** "I went from 520 to 720 in 6 months..."

### SCRIPT:
```
[0-5s HOOK]
Six months ago, my credit score was 520.
Today, it's 720. Here's exactly how I did it.

[5-20s STRUGGLE]
I was denied for an apartment. Denied for a car loan.
Credit card companies laughed at me. I felt stuck.

[20-35s TURNING POINT]
Then I learned about credit repair. Not paying someone—doing
it myself with the right strategies.

I disputed 8 negative items. Got 5 deleted.
Added authorized user tradelines.
Got a secured card and kept it under 10%.

[35-50s RESULTS]
Month 1: 520 to 580
Month 3: 580 to 650  
Month 6: 650 to 720

Now I'm approved for everything.

## 📹 VIDEO 3: WEDNESDAY - Dispute Tutorial
**Title:** "How to Write Dispute Letters That Actually Work"
**Hook:** "Here's the fastest way to write dispute letters..."

### SCRIPT:
```
[0-5s HOOK]
I'm going to show you how to write a dispute letter that gets
negative items deleted. This is the same template I used.

[5-15s PREREQUISITES]
You need: your credit report, account numbers, and this template.

[15-30s STEP 1]
Address it to the credit bureau. Not the creditor—the bureau.
Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion.

[30-45s STEP 2]
State the facts. "This account is inaccurate."
"I never made this payment late."
Be specific about what's wrong.

[45-55s STEP 3]
Demand deletion. Under FCRA 611, if they can't verify in
30 days, they must delete. Give them that deadline.

## 📹 VIDEO 4: THURSDAY - Lower Utilization (Quick Win)
**Title:** "This 5-Minute Trick Added 40 Points to My Score"
**Hook:** "Most people miss this easy win..."

### SCRIPT:
```
[0-3s HOOK]
This one trick added 40 points to my credit score in 30 days.

[3-10s PROBLEM]
Your credit utilization is probably killing your score.
That's the percentage of credit you're using.

Maxed out cards? You're at 100%. That's terrible.

[10-40s SOLUTION]
Here's the fix: Pay your balance BEFORE the statement date.

Most people pay on the due date. Wrong.
The statement balance is what gets reported.

Pay it down to 1% before the statement closes.
Your score will jump.

[40-50s RESULTS]
Went from 85% utilization to 5%.
Score jumped 43 points in one month.

## 📹 VIDEO 5: FRIDAY - Closing Old Cards (Myth Buster)
**Title:** "Stop Closing Old Credit Cards (It's Hurting You)"
**Hook:** "Stop closing old credit cards immediately"

### SCRIPT:
```
[0-3s HOOK]
Stop closing your old credit cards. You're destroying your score.

[3-10s AGITATE]
People think "I don't use this card, I'll close it."
That's a 30-50 point mistake.

[10-45s TRUTH]
Two reasons:

One: Credit age. Old accounts = trust. Close it, your average
age drops, score drops.

Two: Credit limit. Close a $5,000 card, your total available
credit drops. Your utilization spikes. Score drops.

[45-55s PROOF]
Client closed her oldest card. Score dropped 47 points overnight.
Took 8 months to recover.

[5-15s PREREQUISITES]

[15-30s STEP 1]

**Hook:** "I got $50,000 in business credit without using my personal credit..."

### SCRIPT:
```
[0-5s HOOK]
I got $50,000 in business credit without using my personal credit score.
Here's how.

[5-20s STRUGGLE]
I wanted to start a business, but my personal credit was shot.
Banks laughed at me. Couldn't get a business loan.

[20-35s TURNING POINT]
Then I learned about business credit. It's completely separate
from personal credit.

I formed an LLC. Got an EIN. Built business credit with Net-30 vendors.
Started with small accounts. Paid them early.

[35-50s RESULTS]
Month 3: First business credit card - $2,000 limit
Month 6: Second card - $10,000 limit
Month 12: Line of credit - $50,000

Never touched my personal credit.
